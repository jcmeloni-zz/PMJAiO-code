# PMJAiO-code

This repository contains the sample code used in *Sams Teach Yourself PHP, MySQL and JavaScript All-in-One* (2017). 

All the PHP code for this edition of the book is based on the latest version of PHP available at the time of writing (7.1.x in this case), although it is backwards-compatible to 5.6.x.

The sample HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP is organized into directories corresponding to the chapter number in which the code can be found in the book.

## About the Book

This book takes the most useful parts of *Sams Teach Yourself HTML, CSS and JavaScript All in One (Second Edition)* and *Sams Teach Yourself PHP, MySQL and Apache All in One (Fifth Edition)*, refreshes the content for the inevitable changes in technology that happen every day, and provides you with a foundation for "full stack" web application development.

This foundation is provided by example; this book scaffolds your understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP (plus database interactivity with MySQL) by showing you code that builds upon other code, explaining the details of the code, and providing you with sample output--what it might look like on your screen.

This book is not intended as the be-all and end-all of your education in this matter: it’s a **first step**, which will hopefully illuminate the pathways of all the other steps you will need to take to become an expert in these areas.

The book's ISBN is 0672337703, and will be published by Sams in late 2017.
